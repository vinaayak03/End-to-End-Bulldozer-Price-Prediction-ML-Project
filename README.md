This project aims to predict the sale prices of bulldozers at auctions using historical data. The model is built using Python with libraries such as Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately forecast future bulldozer prices based on past sales data.

The dataset used in this project contains various attributes such as equipment details, sale dates, and usage metrics. These attributes are analyzed to build a model that can predict auction prices effectively. The dataset can be downloaded from the Bulldozer Price Prediction competition on Kaggle.

The project involves several key steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. During data preprocessing, missing values are handled, and categorical variables are transformed into numerical formats. Exploratory data analysis is performed using Pandas and Matplotlib to understand patterns in the data. Feature engineering is used to create new features like the age of the equipment and the year of the auction, which help improve the model's performance.

Multiple machine learning models are trained using Scikit-learn, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. These models are evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to assess their accuracy. The final model predicts bulldozer auction prices based on the features derived from the dataset.

To run the project, first ensure that the necessary Python libraries are installed, including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. Once the dataset is downloaded and placed in the project directory, running the script will clean the data, train the model, and produce predictions. The modelâ€™s accuracy can be further improved by fine-tuning the hyperparameters.

This project serves as an example of applying machine learning techniques to real-world data in order to solve a prediction problem. By following this approach, you can gain practical experience in working with data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training using Python.
